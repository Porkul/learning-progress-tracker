# Learning Progress Tracker

In this project, we're diving deep into string manipulation, data processing, SOLID principles, and much more. By the end of it, you'll have an interactive command-line-based Learning Progress Tracker.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Practice with loops and flow controls.
- Familiarize with functional decomposition.
- Understand and implement SOLID principles.
- Dive into string processing techniques.
- Learn to use suitable collections for data manipulation.

## Project Stages:

### Stage 1/5: No empty lines here
**Objective**: Establish the backbone of the system where commands can be read and executed.

**Tasks**:
- Read input from the user.
- Identify a set of predefined commands.
- Respond to each command accordingly.

### Stage 2/5: Verify new users
**Objective**: Enhance our tracker with a registration verification system.

**Tasks**:
- Read registration data from the user.
- Check the provided data against certain patterns or criteria.
- Notify the user if their registration details are valid or not.

### Stage 3/5: A detailed record
**Objective**: Track the learning progress of each student.

**Tasks**:
- Read learning progress data from the console.
- Verify the format of the provided data.
- Update user records based on the data received.

### Stage 4/5: Retrieving statistics
**Objective**: Extract and display various statistics regarding students and courses.

**Tasks**:
- Calculate statistics like average scores, highest scorers, course popularity, etc.
- Display the data based on different criteria as chosen by the user.
